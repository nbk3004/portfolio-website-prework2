Prework #2 for ReDI Web Developer Class Fall '24

Build a personal portfolio (4 hours): Let's get into coding in VS Code. Follow this video, code along, and create your personal portfolio page. The video takes around 1 hour. However, coding along and creating your own portfolio page might take another few hours. It is okay if you don't fully finish the project. However, we encourage you to take it as far as possible, as you will use the project during your onboarding weeks.
